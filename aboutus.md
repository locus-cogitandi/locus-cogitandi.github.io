# Overall

**Locus Cogitandi** is a space for latin, classical antiquity things, and much of thinking.

We are a student-run community with a shared passion for Latin, the classics, and deep thought. This blog is a project of the **Roman Language and Culture Club** @ *The Cambridge School*, a community devoted to exploring ancient wisdom and its relevance today.

## Who We Are

- **Aaron D'Souza** — *"Knows everything and nothing"* (**editor-in-chief**)
- **Wyatt Simonson** — *"Got sick for three weeks and read Latin textbooks"* (**chief translator**)
- **Alex Zhu** — *"Goes by A"*

## Special Thanks

We are especially grateful to our Latin teacher and advisor, **Mr. McNair**, who sparked our interest and continuously supports our effort.

In a world of suffering mental health, Seneca’s letter to Lucilius (_Moral Epistles_ 78) is very poignant:

> _Saepe impetum cepi abrumpendae vitae; patris me indulgentissimi senectus retinuit. Cogitavi enim non quam fortiter ego mori possem, sed quam ille fortiter desiderare non posset. Itaque imperavi mihi, ut viverem. Aliquando enim et vivere fortiter facere est._

**Often, I seized an urge to end my life; however, the old age of my most affectionate father held me back. For I thought not how bravely I could embrace death, but how bravely he could not bear my death. Thus, I convinced myself to live, for sometimes even living is to act bravely.**

Although Roman men—and Stoics to an even further extent—are commonly perceived as tough and emotionless, Seneca’s writing teaches us that even then, mental health struggles and depression existed.

With a personal tone, he reminds us that bravery is not only found in big or unique actions, but rather it can often be found in the simple, everyday actions as one conquers their own urges.

In this passage, Seneca doesn't glorify death but instead reveals its devastating effects on both an individual and their loved ones, using his father as an example. His perspective challenges our understanding of courage, persuading us that true bravery may lie not in grand deeds but in the willingness to endure suffering for others' sake. There is quiet dignity in choosing to go on through life's hardships.

This insight goes beyond mere survival. By choosing to live, we acknowledge that our existence extends beyond ourselves and touches countless others. Death's consequences ripple through many lives. Life becomes noble not because of its sorrows, but through the compassion born from these difficult experiences.

Living, then, isn't simply avoiding death—it’s a deliberate stand against despair. It is a commitment to persist out of will, finding dignity even when life seems no longer worth living. And at its core, it is about being strong and centering one’s sentiment not on one’s emotions or surroundings, but the goal to live the virtuous life as a true Stoic.

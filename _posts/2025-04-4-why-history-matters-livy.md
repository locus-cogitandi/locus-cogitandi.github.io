Few voices from antiquity describe the moral function of history as clearly as Livy does in his preface of *Ab Urbe Condita*:

> *Hoc illud est praecipue in cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum, omnis te exempli documenta in inlustri posita monumento intueri; inde tibi tuaeque rei publicae quod imitere capias, inde foedum inceptu foedum exitu quod vites.*

**Here, in thinking about history, it is very healthy and fruitful that you look back at lessons of every type placed clearly on a brilliant monument: from those (things in history), you may take ideas to copy for yourself and your republic. And also, you may dodge that which is ugly from the start, and deplorable at the result.**

With these words, the historian Livy admonishes us to learn from history by using everything as an example that advises us on what things are positive and negative. Such advice is always pertinent, as we are always less than a step away from radicalism and extremism.

Though all hope is not lost, as unlike Hegel’s cynical philosophy, in the real world, there can be progress: Has not racial slavery in the Western world been eradicated? Did not the dynastic cycle of China end?

However, it must be recognized that as soon as we stop looking back at the past and learning, it will happen again. 

And on a more meta note, if in our consideration of history we are told to look back at history and such is observed as both beautiful in itself and its end, surely according to Livy we must not only determine our actions based on history but also continue to historiograph both for ourselves and the future — that they may also learn from history as it is continuously forming.

All this we do in the hope that one day we may reach the true form of civilization: one that is truly beautiful and simply succeeds.

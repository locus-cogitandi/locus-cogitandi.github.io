# Website for Locus Cogitandi 


# About Us

**Locus Cogitandi** is a space for latin, classical antiquity things, and much of thinking.

We are high school students at *The Cambridge School*, with a shared passion for Latin, the classics, and deep thought. This blog is a project of the **Roman Language and Culture Club**, a community devoted to exploring ancient wisdom and its relevance today.

## Who We Are

- **Aaron D'Souza** — *"Knows everything and nothing"*
- **Wyatt Simonson** — *"Got sick for three weeks and read Latin textbooks"*
- **Alex Zhu** — *"Goes by A"*

## Special Thanks

We are especially grateful to our Latin teacher and club advisor, **Mr. McNair**.
